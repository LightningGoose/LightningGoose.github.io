            <hr>

            <div class="box box-blue"><p> The pampas of Nasca are some of the driest places on the planet. 
                Extending along the southern coast of Peru it forms a vast desert plain high above sea level. 
                Within this lies an archaeological treasure that continues to confound researchers: the mysterious Nasca Lines.
                Extending over an area 30 miles long and five miles wide, between the pampas of Nasca and Palpa, is a region covered by hundreds 
                of straight, zigzagging, and trapezoidal lines called geoglyphs. 
                But what has startled researchers and fired the world’s imagination are that some of the lines, largely in the Pampa Colorada, 
                join up to form drawings of animals, plants, and anthropomorphic beings: a condor, a hummingbird.
                and a pelican; a monkey, a spider, a lizard, and human hands. In total there are some 30 drawings of vast dimensions: 
                the pelican is 935 feet long; the iguana over 600 feet long.</p></div>

                <div class="box box-red"><h2>A Bird's-Eye View</h2></div>
                <div class="box box-s"><p> Although the lines were noticed in 1547 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro Cieza de Leon, whose chronicles 
                mentioned ''signs” in the desert, the Nasca lines didn’t arouse archaeological interest until 1926. It was
                then that the Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejia Xesspe was told of some mysterious markings on the ground near the Peruvian coast. 
                He carried out the first on-site research, and concluded that they were Inca trails.
                Then, in the 1930s, American anthropologist Paul Kosok made a trip to southern Peru. Standing at the top of the mesa to view the lines 
                that crossed the pampa below, he decided to study them and proceeded to clean out some of the lines. As he did so he was astonished to 
                find that one of the drawings took on the unmistakable shape of an enormous bird in flight. Kosok flew over Nasca in 1941, confirming that 
                the full splendor of some of the geoglyphs could only be appreciated from the air.
                He came to the conclusion that the drawings were related to the constellations, solstices, and equinoxes; he became convinced that he 
                was contemplating the larg- est astronomy book in the world. But Kosok’s theory did not solve the mystery of who created the lines. 
                Iconographic studies of the drawings were carried out, and they identified some design motifs that appeared in Nasca ceramics and 
                weavings, linking the lines to the pre-Inca culture that developed in the region between A.D. lOO and 600. 
                Carbon-14 dating has since corroborated this theory. The Nasca people drew these extraordinary designs with grooves dug into the 
                ground at depths ranging from less than an inch to 11 inches, the lighter color of the subsoil
                making the drawings clearly visible. The composition of the soil, and the arid climate, with less than a liter of 
                precipitation per year, have both contributed to their remarkable preservation.</p></div>

            <p><div class="float-top-right"><a href="https://placeholder.com"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/170" alt="Bilde av hvor Nasca Lines befinner seg i Peru"></a></div>Maria Reiche had to fight against all sorts of obstacles and misunderstandings while researching the Nasca Lines.
            Reiche would work at night to avoid the glaring sun; the local people, seeing her leave with the brooms she used to clear the lines, 
            became suspicious that she was performing some sort of witchcraft in the desert.</p>
        </div>
        
            <h2 class="box box-teal">A Cosmic Calender</h2>
            <div class="box box-pink"><p>In 1932 the German mathematician Maria Reiche moved to Peru, fleeing the economic depression and the rise of Nazism in her country.
                In Cuzco Reiche took a job as a governess to the German consul's children. Fascinated by Peruvian culture, she soon settled in Lima
                as a German teacher and later took a position at the city's National Museum of Archaeology, where she worked with the famous 
                Peruvian archaeologist Julio C. Tello. There, in 1939, she met Paul Kosok, who in 1941 persuaded her to accompany him to 
                Nasca to help in </p></div>
            
        </div>
                <div class="box box-r"><p>his investigations. From 1946 until her death in 1998, Maria Reiche devoted herself to the study and conservation of the Nasca lines. Like Kosok, she was Sirius, Canopus, 
                    and Alpha Aurigae . . . functioning as a large-scale agricultural cal- endar," she recorded. Reiche laid out her theories in 
                    several highly successful books, including Ancient Peruvian Contributions to Geometry and Astronomy, published in 1968.
                    The perplexing fact that the lines can only be properly viewed from the air has given rise to all sorts of theories: 
                    In 1968 the Swiss writer Erich von Daniken claimed that they were landing strips for alien spaceships. 
                    But Reiche proposed another explanation: "Assuming that the creators of the lines couldn't fly, they could only imagine 
                    the full appearance of their works and must have planned and drawn them out ahead of time on a smaller scale." 
                    Others thought differently.</p></div>
